This is a pet project to build my own window manager. You know what they say, the the first step to Rome wasn't built in a single 1000 days.

So far this only creates a window. I combined information from these two sources (the MSU one seems outdated)
https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x/
http://mech.math.msu.su/~nap/2/GWindow/xintro.html

Next I will look at this source, look for other general information / examples of simple window managers, and look in more depth at the source code of dwm.
